Contributor guidelines
======================

This document contains a set of rules and guidelines for everyone who wishes
to contribute to the contents of this repository, hereafter referred to as
"the software".


General
-------
All contributors implicitly agree to license their contribution under the same
terms as the rest of the software, and accept that those terms may change in the
future.  See the `LICENCE.txt` file for details.

All contributions to the software, in the form of changes, removals or
additions to source code and other files under source control, shall be made
via pull requests.  A pull request must always be reviewed and merged by someone
other than its author.

Before a pull request can be approved and merged into the code base, the author 
must sign the "OSP Contributor License Agreement". This agreement is pending, but 
will be included in this repository with guidelines once concluded.
