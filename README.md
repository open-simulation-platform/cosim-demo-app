# cse-server-go
playground for testing go as an alternative for the cse-server

# Get going (windows)
- install [go](https://golang.org/dl/)
- environmental variables must be defined
    - [GOROOT](https://golang.org/doc/install#tarball_non_standard) - directory where go is installed
    - [GOPATH](https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-GOPATH_environment_variable) - where to look for Go files
- install [MinGW-w64](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/?source=typ_redirect) (TODO: Should investigate using VS)
- csecorec.dll and csecorecpp.dll must be manually copied into cse-server-go root folder
- go build will compile executable
